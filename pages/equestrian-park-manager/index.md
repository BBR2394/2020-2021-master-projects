# introduction
Horse management system is a web application that allow Stable Supervisor to manage their stable and the Horse livery.

## Project context
This pproject is a student roject that took place in my Master degree at the catholic univerity of Lille. The goal is to make a 20 hours pproject, on the domain of our choice, so, I have choosen to make a web application.
The idea of this project came to me when I discuss with my family, that some existing solution to manage stable and horses in this stable, to follow their live and medication. So the final goal was to create a POC of this kind of project.

Also, the goal for me, is to develop and gain new skills in the web technologies in order to be more confidence too. And also to be able to start a pproject from scratch, or to fully and better understand an existing pproject if I have to work on an existing project.

## Project fullfilment and realization
This project allow me to progress in the web technologie choosen : Node JS and Vue JS. I discover a new css framework too : Bulma ; even if I couldn't take much time to create a nice user interface yet. I also train Postgre SQL request to work my knowledge in it.

I manage to create a "first draft" and a base that can support evolution and progression for this project.

Today, i manage to gain knowledge, to be more confident by creating from scratch a project, to 

## Issue during the realization
Some problem happened during the realization of the project
- General organisation: </br> I used the hours of class more to initalize and start the project, and all the rest of the project has been done after these hours. And I had some difficulties to motivate myself to work the project all along the months 
- time estimation :</br> And one of the other problem is I under estimated the time to develop the project, and all along the developppement, some issue and idea came that I should and must solve and implement in the project ...
- 

## futur evolution
Althought the project is not fully done, I can continue to developp it in order to, first, just finished it, to continue to gain in knowledge, and to have a good and nice project that I could show for a job interview.

However the first step is to clean and refactor the code, because I made some mistake and bad way to implement some feature : in the back part, for '/horse' path for the request are not made with the router, while I used it for the other routes.

Also I should add some tools to help me to develop : a CI/CD ; today CD/CI are something very usefull but often forgotten in student project, so I could add one  

## The project : techical part
So it is a web aplication made with different tecnologie, which is comosed of Two main part :
- **the back end part** : Whic is compopsed of a data manager and connect to the database. The technologie used is Node JS for the api management, and PPostgre SQL as the databse

### Why this choice
Postgre SQL is a relational database that work with almost the same SQL syntaxe. 
I have choosen this system because I wanted to continue to work with this syntaxe, in order to improve my knowledge and the general syntaxe.
Postgre SQL has some advantages compare to MySQL and MariaDB
And in my company, they used
