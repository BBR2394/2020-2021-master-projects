# Introduction

The goal of this project was for me to learn how to develop a game on flutter.
I had no knowledge on flutter at that time and was curious of the possibility to create a game
compatible on Android and IOS.

## The idea of the game

At the start of my project, I was wondering what kind of game offline I can develop and would be interesting
for the players, then I was reminded of **Cookie clicker** :

The goal of this game was to produce the largest amount of cookie possible automatically and rapidly, the players
needed to spam at the start of the game endlessly that giant cookie we can see at the center of the picture, in order later
to automate the production by using the bonus on the right corner of the screen.

I wanted my game to take some aspect of **Cookie Clicker**, so I made a quick list of what to use in it :

> **Principal goals :**
>
> - having an offline game with a level of difficulty increasing over time,
> - adding bonus items in order to help the player to pass each level with more ease,
> - allowing the player to start over the game with his item, in order to gain more money for the level he founded difficult to pass,

> **Auxiliary goals :**
>
> - synchronising the game with a database (Firecloud here), in order to update bosses, items...
> - allowing the user to share his score when he encounters a game over, the score can later be showed in a website

        which will be used for a ranking system.

## Rebirth Hero

With the possibility to start all over the game, I decided to call my game **Rebirth Hero**, I gave the application a
medieval style because I love this universe :
